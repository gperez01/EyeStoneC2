## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, we ask that you **disclose it responsibly** by using the GitHub's **Security Advisories** feature

- Include as much information as possible to help us reproduce and fix the issue quickly (e.g., proof of concept, steps to reproduce, impact).
- Allow us a reasonable time to investigate and resolve the issue before any public disclosure.
